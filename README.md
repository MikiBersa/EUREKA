## Description of service:
Our innovative service allows bank customers to collateralize part of their liquidity in their current account. In return, you receive an immediate loan of up to 90% of the collateralized value. The blocked liquidity is released as soon as the customer repays the loan and the accrued interest. If the customer fails to honor the debt, the bank could draw the collateral immediately.

The service is based on a private blockchain of the bank, where all phases of the loan are recorded: disbursement, repayments, interest calculation, repaid amount, etc.

## Service benefits:
Speed: The customer can have a loan approved in seconds. The same goes for repayments and loan repayments.
Reduction of risks for the bank: The money is blocked and is not subject to withdrawals, so the bank can reclaim the blocked liquidity if the customer does not repay. This system also eliminates the debt collection costs of traditional lending methods.
Accurate and immutable record: The blockchain allows you to have an accurate and immutable history of transactions, reducing the possibility of human errors.


## Operation via blockchain:
Web3.0 platform that interacts with the bank's management system.
When the customer accepts the contract for a loan (maximum 90% of the collateralized capital), a wallet is generated which will be associated with the customer's CC, and an oracle will query whether the characteristics of the contract can be respected or not.
Then the smart contract is interrogated which generates 1 Token = 1â‚¬, in order to save the liquidity blocked by the user on the bank's private blockchain that can be used by the bank, minting the tokens which will then be sent to the customer as a guarantee of the blocked money. The customer then receives the amount in euros of the requested loan together with the number of tokens that guarantee the blocked liquidity.
On the blockchain, all the characteristics of the loan will then be written in the metadata:
* Timing for payment of installments (monthly, quarterly, etc.);
* % interest;
* Minimum and maximum amount to request as a loan;
* NDG, which is associated with the wallet address that will be generated upon "signing the contract";
* Capital to be repaid each installment;
* Expiry of future installments;

These tokens will then be "burned" as the customer pays the loan, unlocking the initial liquidity, or if the customer fails to comply with the conditions of the smart contract, this capital will no longer be available to the customer, leaving it totally managed by the bank.
For example, if after 3 consecutive installments, or more than 6 months late, the customer fails to repay the loan, these tokens are burned and the liquidity will not be returned.
These features can be agreed with the bank.

## Revenue model:
The business idea is supported thanks to a remuneration based on a percentage of the amount of the loans activated through this system, as well as a fixed cost per transaction on the blockchain to be defined.
