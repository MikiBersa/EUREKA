## Description of service:
Our innovative service allows bank customers to collateralize part of their liquidity in their current account. In return, you receive an immediate loan of up to 90% of the collateralized value. The blocked liquidity is released as soon as the customer repays the loan and the accrued interest. If the customer fails to honor the debt, the bank could draw the collateral immediately.

The service is based on a private blockchain of the bank, where all phases of the loan are recorded: disbursement, repayments, interest calculation, repaid amount, etc.

## Service benefits:
Service benefits:

Speed: The customer can have a loan approved in seconds. The same goes for repayments and loan repayments.
Reduction of risks for the bank: The money is blocked and is not subject to withdrawals, so the bank can reclaim the blocked liquidity if the customer does not repay. This system also eliminates the debt collection costs of traditional lending methods.
Accurate and immutable record: The blockchain allows you to have an accurate and immutable history of transactions, reducing the possibility of human errors.
Revenue model:

The business idea is supported thanks to a remuneration based on a percentage of the amount of the loans activated through this system, as well as a fixed cost per transaction on the blockchain to be defined.
